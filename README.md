# flappy bird!
This simple flappy bird clone demonstrates the capabilities of my [flgl](https://github.com/collebrusco/flgl) and [entity-mini](https://github.com/collebrusco/entity-mini) libraries.

300 lines of the main file make up this entire game, along with simple shaders and a camera class. This shows the simplicity of flgl's syntax and use, and the same of my entity system. See their repos for more.
